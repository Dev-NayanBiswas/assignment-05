***
*This project is about Basic DOM manipulation, and reusable functions, loops and javascript event handlers*
_Here i used few methods of JS and custom made modal. As far as I tried to avoid repeating same codes again n again though few things can be refactored but I managed somehow_
_Here is a brief summary about the functionality of this project_

1. _Instead of adding event handlers manually I took the advantages of event **Delegation**, In the main part I tried to use same Function `global()` for all parent nodes_
2. _Few DOM element selector needed to keep outside of functions though it was possible to manage inside functions_
3. _In `global()` I done the code **sanitization** in all ways possible to do as Requirements, User can't enter any falsy input here, like null, undefined, spaces and negative numbers_
4. _User can toggle between Donation and History panels, where Donation is **autofocus** in by default, and both donation and History button is visually active whenever they will be clicked_
5. _On the first stage History panel will show an Empty message and it will be disappeared whenever User will Donate_
6. _Here I used Only one modal by Every possible way I could_
7. _**Tailwind custom classes** added to get a better overview_
8. _**LordIcon** added to get a little bit animations_
9. _In FAQ section I used only one **callBack function** for all elements, where curious user can get there answer by clicking on any question, and FAQ section has a Home Button if any change of mind for Donation happens_
10. _**querySelector()**,**classList.add()**, **classList.remove()**, **getAttribute()**, **setAttribute()**, **getElementByTagName()**, **currenTarget**, **event Delegation-eventBubbling**, **reusable Functions**, **reusable Components**, **passing props through Functions**, **Closures** all you can find in this Project_
